Audio synthesis in R

play(curry(overtones, rnorm(10), square, 40))
play(curry(overtones, 1:10, square, 440))

My speakers are better at playing A than other notes in
the A major scale?

    f <- function(x) 2^10 * tuneR::Wave(sine(x, SECOND/2))
    xs <- P.n(49 - P8 + c(scales$major, P8 + scales$major, P8 + P8))
    tuneR::play(Reduce(tuneR::bind, lapply(xs, f)), 'play')

Why are these different?

play(2^12 * tuneR::Wave(left = sine(440, SECOND/4), samp.rate = SECOND, bit = 16), 'play')
play(2^12 * tuneR::sine(440, SECOND/4), 'play')


Organ

play(tuneR::normalize(wave(SECOND, curry(multiple.frequencies, 440 * (1:6), sawtooth), fade = fade.none), unit = '16'), 'play')
